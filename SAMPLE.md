## Installation
Here are some sample instructions for installation. The details would depend on the type of project being implemented.
## Usage
Here is some sample usage information for the project. I can use **bold** and other `stylings` within this paragraph and they will render correctly into MarkDown format when being written to the file.
## License
The MIT license gives users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, sometimes even if code is part of proprietary software. As long as users include the original copy of the MIT license in their distribution, they can make any changes or modifications to the code to suit their own needs.
## Contributing
Here is some sample text to describe how contributions would be made to the project at hand. Perhaps there's a separate CONTRIBUTIONS.md file within the repo.
## Tests
Here is some sample text to show the user how to run tests within my project. Perhaps those tests are implemented via the **Jest** package, and therefore the user should execute `npm run test` on the console.
