# README Generator

## Description

A simple Node.js command line tool that generates a polished README file (named SAMPLE.md by default, so that the repo README is not overwritten) after gathering input for each section from the user. The project includes the following features in accordance with the challenge guidelines:
- Proper setup of the `.gitignore` file to prevent `node_modules` and other extraneous system files from being tracked.
- Use of the **Inquirer** package to gather user input.
- Use of both `input` and `list` question types.
- Use of Node's `fs` module to write the finished README file.
   
## Usage

Proper use of the tool requires **Node.js** and relies on the **Inquirer** package as an additional dependency. After cloning the repo, run `npm i` in the project root directory to install Inquirer and its dependencies. Then, to start using the tool, run `node index.js`.
